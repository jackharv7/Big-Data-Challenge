- In total Vine Customer Reviews is responsible for 0.12% (10,975) of Amazon reviews and Non Vine Customers account for 99.88% (9,205,504) of the
total Amazon Reviews.

- The percentage of Vine customers vs Non Vine customers with reviews of 4 and 5 stars was 82% for Vine customers and 
79% for Non-Vine customers.

- On average, the percentage of helpful votes from Non Vine customer reviews was 98% with the top 5 reviews with the most number of

- While the percentage of helful votes for Vine customers reviews was 77% for a one star review, 96% for a 4 star review, 84% for a 3 star review,
and 96% for a 5 star review.

- I do not believe there is bias in the vine reviews becasue the number of 4 and 5 star reviews is not much greater than the number of 4
and 5 star reviews for Non Vine customers.

- There is not enough evidence to prove that the Vine user's are only giving 4 and 5 star reviews because there is a normal distribution 
of one,two and three star reviews for both Vine users and Non Vine user's considering the number of each type.
